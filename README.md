AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles


My task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so I also wrote a unit test for every part of my code and ensure that it passes each test.

Because this application wonâ€™t be deployed, I need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the tests passing. I need to submit a link to the video AND add it to the readme of your project.


This was definitely one the hardest stepping stones to overcome.
Classes-
requirer
and logic and planning.
